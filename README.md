# Battle Project
Data structure project 

The project is a simulation program that models a battle between a castle and its enemies. The simulation is based on data that is read from an input file. The input file contains a list of enemies, each represented as a line of text. Each line of text contains information about a single enemy, such as its type, arrival time, health, power, and firing delay.

The program uses different data structures to store and manage the information about the enemies and the battle. For example, it uses a queue to store the enemies that are waiting to attack the castle, and a priority queue to store the enemies that are currently attacking the castle, ordered by their firing delay. The program  also uses arrays or vectors to store information about the castle's defenses, such as its towers.

During the simulation, the program advances time step by step, and updates the state of the battle based on the actions of the enemies and the castle. For example, it moves enemies from the waiting queue to the attacking queue when their arrival time is reached, or it reduces the health of a tower when an enemy attacks it. The program also generates output to a file or to the console to show the progress of the battle and the actions taken by the enemies and the castle.
